# Assignment 5 - Data Structures and Strings in Python

This repo has my solutions for Assignment 5.  
I have done Task 1 and Task 2 using Python. Below I am explaining what each task does.  

---

## Task 1: Lists and Tuples
- In this task I practiced how to use **lists** and **tuples** in Python.  
- I created a list, added some elements, removed some, and also did slicing.  
- Then I created a tuple and showed how to access its elements.  
- Example: I stored some numbers in a list and printed only even numbers.  

---

## Task 2: Dictionary and Sets
- In this task I worked with **dictionary** and **sets**.  
- Dictionary was used to store keyâ€“value pairs like name, age, and city.  
- I added new values, updated some data, and removed one element.  
- In sets, I performed union, intersection and difference between two sets.  
- Example: I checked which students are common in two different subjects using sets.
